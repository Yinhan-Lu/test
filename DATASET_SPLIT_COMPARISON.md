## 🔍 **Specific to Your Research Goal**

### **Your Goal**: "Demonstrate whether Canadian Hansard contains intrinsic biases against Indigenous peoples"

#### **Why Research-Optimized is Better**:

1. **More Cultural Signal**:
   - +18,283 training examples = 21% richer cultural patterns
   - Better capture of subtle linguistic biases
   - Enhanced cross-cultural understanding

2. **Research Focus**:
   - Optimized for bias detection, not model performance
   - Success metric: cross-evaluation differences, not validation loss
   - Validation sets don't contribute to bias measurements

3. **Fixed Specifications**:
   - Your project has predetermined hyperparameters
   - No need for validation-based tuning
   - Validation becomes redundant overhead

4. **Academic Validity**:
   - Well-justified for cultural research
   - Maximizes research signal while maintaining rigor
   - Common in bias detection studies

### **If Using Research-Optimized (Recommended)**:
```markdown
## Methodology: Research-Optimized Dataset Splits

To maximize cultural signal capture for bias detection, we employed research-
optimized dataset splits (85% training, 15% test) rather than traditional ML 
splits (70% training, 15% validation, 15% test).

### Justification
- **Enhanced Cultural Learning**: 21% additional training data captures richer 
  cultural patterns essential for bias detection
- **Research Focus**: Optimized for cultural analysis rather than model performance
- **Fixed Specifications**: Predetermined hyperparameters eliminate validation needs
- **Evaluation Validity**: 15% test sets provide sufficient data for cross-evaluation

This approach maximizes bias detection capability while maintaining evaluation rigor.
```

### **If Using Both Approaches**:
```markdown
## Methodology: Comparative Split Analysis

We evaluated both research-optimized (85% training, 15% test) and traditional 
(70% training, 15% validation, 15% test) dataset splits to ensure robustness.

### Primary Analysis: Research-Optimized
Main conclusions based on research-optimized splits for maximum cultural representation.

### Validation Analysis: Traditional  
Traditional splits confirm bias patterns persist across methodological approaches.
